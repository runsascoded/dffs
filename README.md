### `diff-x` <a id="diff-x"></a>

#### Usage <a id="diff-x-usage"></a>
<!-- `bmdf -r2 diff-x` -->
```bash
diff-x
# Usage: diff-x [OPTIONS] [exec_cmd...] <path1> <path2>
#
#   Diff two files after running them through a pipeline of other commands.
#
# Options:
#   -c, --color / --no-color     Colorize the output (default: auto, based on
#                                TTY)
#   -P, --pipefail               Check all pipeline commands for errors (like
#                                bash's `set -o pipefail`); default only checks
#                                last command
#   -s, --shell-executable TEXT  Shell to use for executing commands; defaults
#                                to $SHELL
#   -S, --no-shell               Don't pass `shell=True` to Python
#                                `subprocess`es
#   -U, --unified INTEGER        Number of lines of context to show (passes
#                                through to `diff`)
#   -V, --version                Show version and exit
#   -v, --verbose                Log intermediate commands to stderr
#   -w, --ignore-whitespace      Ignore whitespace differences (pass `-w` to
#                                `diff`)
#   -x, --exec-cmd TEXT          Command(s) to execute before invoking `comm`;
#                                alternate syntax to passing commands as
#                                positional arguments
#   --help                       Show this message and exit.
```

#### Examples <a id="diff-x-examples"></a>

Given two similar JSON objects, where one is compact and the other is pretty-printed:
```bash
echo '{"a":1,"b":2}' > 1.json
echo '{"a":1,"b":3}' | jq > 2.json 
```

`diff {1,2}.json` outputs the entirety of both objects:
```diff
1c1,4
< {"a":1,"b":2}
---
> {
>   "a": 1,
>   "b": 3
> }
```

`diff-x 'jq .' {1,2}.json` pretty-prints each side before `diff`ing:
```diff
3c3
<   "b": 2
---
>   "b": 3
```

### `comm-x` <a id="comm-x"></a>
`comm` essentially performs set intersection/difference; `comm-x` allows you to run a pipeline of commands on each input, before comparing them.

#### Usage <a id="comm-x-usage"></a>
<!-- `bmdf -r2 comm-x` -->
```bash
comm-x
# Usage: comm-x [OPTIONS] [exec_cmd...] <path1> <path2>
#
#   Select or reject lines common to two input streams, after running each
#   through a pipeline of other commands.
#
# Options:
#   -1, --exclude-1              Exclude lines only found in the first pipeline
#   -2, --exclude-2              Exclude lines only found in the second pipeline
#   -3, --exclude-3              Exclude lines found in both pipelines
#   -i, --case-insensitive       Case insensitive comparison
#   -s, --shell-executable TEXT  Shell to use for executing commands; defaults
#                                to $SHELL
#   -S, --no-shell               Don't pass `shell=True` to Python
#                                `subprocess`es
#   -V, --version                Show version and exit
#   -v, --verbose                Log intermediate commands to stderr
#   -x, --exec-cmd TEXT          Command(s) to execute before invoking `comm`;
#                                alternate syntax to passing commands as
#                                positional arguments
#   --help                       Show this message and exit.
```

#### Examples <a id="comm-x-examples"></a>
Given two similar lists of numbers, but in different orders:
```bash
seq 10 > 1.txt
seq 10 -2 0 > 2.txt
```

`comm` outputs gibberish, because the files aren't in sorted order:
<!-- `bmdf -r1 comm 1.txt 2.txt` -->
```bash
comm 1.txt 2.txt
# 1
# 	10
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 		8
# comm: file 2 is not in sorted order
# 	6
# 	4
# 	2
# 	0
# 9
# comm: file 1 is not in sorted order
# 10
# comm: input is not in sorted order
```

`comm-x sort` sorts each file first:
<!-- `bmdf comm-x sort 1.txt 2.txt` -->
```bash
comm-x sort 1.txt 2.txt
# 	0
# 1
# 		10
# 		2
# 3
# 		4
# 5
# 		6
# 7
# 		8
# 9
```

### `git-diff-x` <a id="git-diff-x"></a>

#### Usage <a id="git-diff-x-usage"></a>
<!-- `bmdf -r2 -- git-diff-x` -->
```bash
git-diff-x
# Usage: git-diff-x [OPTIONS] [exec_cmd...] [<path> | - [paths...]]
#
#   Diff files at two commits, or one commit and the current worktree, after
#   applying an optional command pipeline.
#
#   Examples:
#
#   # Compare the number of lines (`wc -l`) in file `foo` at the previous vs.
#   current commit (`-r HEAD^..HEAD`):
#
#   git diff-x -r HEAD^..HEAD wc -l foo
#
#   # Colorized (`-c`) diff of `md5sum`s of `foo`, at HEAD (last committed
#   value) vs. the current worktree content:
#
#   git diff-x -c md5sum foo
#
#   # Use `-` to separate pipeline commands from paths (when more than one path
#   is to be diffed), e.g. this compares the largest 10 numbers in `file{1,2}`
#   (HEAD vs. worktree):
#
#   git diff-x 'sort -rn' head - file1 file2
#
# Options:
#   -c, --color / --no-color     Colorize the output (default: auto, based on
#                                TTY)
#   -r, --refspec TEXT           <commit 1>..<commit 2> (compare two commits) or
#                                <commit> (compare <commit> to the worktree)
#   -R, --ref TEXT               Diff a specific commit; alias for `-r
#                                <ref>^..<ref>`
#   -t, --staged                 Compare HEAD vs. staged changes (index)
#   -P, --pipefail               Check all pipeline commands for errors (like
#                                bash's `set -o pipefail`); default only checks
#                                last command
#   -s, --shell-executable TEXT  Shell to use for executing commands; defaults
#                                to $SHELL
#   -S, --no-shell               Don't pass `shell=True` to Python
#                                `subprocess`es
#   -U, --unified INTEGER        Number of lines of context to show (passes
#                                through to `diff`)
#   -V, --version                Show version and exit
#   -v, --verbose                Log intermediate commands to stderr
#   -w, --ignore-whitespace      Ignore whitespace differences (pass `-w` to
#                                `diff`)
#   -x, --exec-cmd TEXT          Command(s) to execute before invoking `comm`;
#                                alternate syntax to passing commands as
#                                positional arguments
#   --help                       Show this message and exit.
```

#### Examples <a id="git-diff-x-examples"></a>
Compare line-count (`wc -l`) of this README, before and after commit `8b7a761`:
<!-- `bmdf -r1 -- git-diff-x -R 8b7a761 'wc -l' README.md` -->
```bash
git-diff-x -R 8b7a761 'wc -l' README.md
# 1c1
# < 16
# ---
# > 206
```

Examples from `--help` above:
```bash
# Compare the number of lines (`wc -l`) in file `foo` at the previous vs. current commit
# (`-R HEAD` is equivalent to `-r HEAD^..HEAD`).
git diff-x -R HEAD wc -l foo

# Colorized (`-c`) diff of `md5sum`s of `foo`, at HEAD (last committed value) vs. the current
# worktree content.
git diff-x -c md5sum foo

# Use `-` to separate pipeline commands from paths (when more than one path is to be diffed),
# e.g. this compares the largest 10 numbers in `file{1,2}` (HEAD vs. worktree):
git diff-x 'sort -rn' head - file1 file2
```

## Shell Integration <a id="shell-integration"></a>

Add convenient aliases to your shell by adding this to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(dffs-shell-integration bash)"
```

This provides aliases with the following suffix conventions:
- `c` = color, `n` = no-color, `w` = ignore-whitespace
- `r` = ref (`-R`, compare commit to parent), `s` = refspec (`-r`), `t` = staged (`--staged`)

### Examples

| Alias | Expands to |
|-------|------------|
| `dx` | `diff-x` |
| `dxc` | `diff-x --color` |
| `cx` | `comm-x` |
| `gdx` | `git diff-x` |
| `gdxc` | `git diff-x --color` |
| `gdxr` | `git diff-x -R` (compare commit to parent) |
| `gdxs` | `git diff-x -r` (explicit refspec) |
| `gdxt` | `git diff-x --staged` |
| `gdxcr` | `git diff-x --color -R` |
| `gdxtw` | `git diff-x --staged -w` |

To see all available aliases:
```bash
dffs-shell-integration bash
```

To load only aliases for a specific command:
```bash
eval "$(dffs-shell-integration bash git-diff-x)"
```
