### `diff-x` <a id="diff-x"></a>

#### Usage <a id="diff-x-usage"></a>
<!-- `bmdf diff-x` -->
```bash
diff-x
# Usage: diff-x [OPTIONS] [exec_cmd...] <path1> <path2>
#
#   Diff two files after running them through a pipeline of other commands.
#
# Options:
#   -c, --color                  Colorize the output
#   -s, --shell-executable TEXT  Shell to use for executing commands; defaults
#                                to $SHELL
#   -S, --no-shell               Don't pass `shell=True` to Python
#                                `subprocess`es
#   -U, --unified INTEGER        Number of lines of context to show (passes
#                                through to `diff`)
#   -v, --verbose                Log intermediate commands to stderr
#   -w, --ignore-whitespace      Ignore whitespace differences (pass `-w` to
#                                `diff`)
#   -x, --exec-cmd TEXT          Command(s) to execute before invoking `comm`;
#                                alternate syntax to passing commands as
#                                positional arguments
#   --help                       Show this message and exit.
```

#### Examples <a id="diff-x-examples"></a>

Given two similar JSON objects, where one is compact and the other is pretty-printed:
```bash
echo '{"a":1,"b":2}' > 1.json
echo '{"a":1,"b":3}' | jq > 2.json 
```

`diff {1,2}.json` outputs the entirety of both objects:
```diff
1c1,4
< {"a":1,"b":2}
---
> {
>   "a": 1,
>   "b": 3
> }
```

`diff-x 'jq .' {1,2}.json` pretty-prints each side before `diff`ing:
```diff
3c3
<   "b": 2
---
>   "b": 3
```

### `comm-x` <a id="comm-x"></a>
`comm` essentially performs set intersection/difference; `comm-x` allows you to run a pipeline of commands on each input, before comparing them.

#### Usage <a id="comm-x-usage"></a>
<!-- `bmdf comm-x` -->
```bash
comm-x
# Usage: comm-x [OPTIONS] [exec_cmd...] <path1> <path2>
#
#   Select or reject lines common to two input streams, after running each
#   through a pipeline of other commands.
#
# Options:
#   -1, --exclude-1              Exclude lines only found in the first pipeline
#   -2, --exclude-2              Exclude lines only found in the second pipeline
#   -3, --exclude-3              Exclude lines found in both pipelines
#   -i, --case-insensitive       Case insensitive comparison
#   -s, --shell-executable TEXT  Shell to use for executing commands; defaults
#                                to $SHELL
#   -S, --no-shell               Don't pass `shell=True` to Python
#                                `subprocess`es
#   -v, --verbose                Log intermediate commands to stderr
#   -x, --exec-cmd TEXT          Command(s) to execute before invoking `comm`;
#                                alternate syntax to passing commands as
#                                positional arguments
#   --help                       Show this message and exit.
```

#### Examples <a id="comm-x-examples"></a>
Given two similar lists of numbers, but in different orders:
```bash
seq 10 > 1.txt
seq 10 -2 0 > 2.txt
```

`comm` outputs gibberish, because the files aren't in sorted order:
<!-- `bmdf comm 1.txt 2.txt` -->
```bash
comm 1.txt 2.txt
# 1
# 	10
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 		8
# comm: file 2 is not in sorted order
# 	6
# 	4
# 	2
# 	0
# 9
# comm: file 1 is not in sorted order
# 10
# comm: input is not in sorted order
```

`comm-x sort` sorts each file first:
<!-- `bmdf comm-x sort 1.txt 2.txt` -->
```bash
comm-x sort 1.txt 2.txt
# 	0
# 1
# 		10
# 		2
# 3
# 		4
# 5
# 		6
# 7
# 		8
# 9
```

### `git-diff-x` <a id="git-diff-x"></a>

#### Usage <a id="git-diff-x-usage"></a>
<!-- `bmdf -- git-diff-x --help` -->
```bash
git-diff-x --help
# Usage: git-diff-x [OPTIONS] [exec_cmd...] [<path> | - [paths...]]
#
#   Diff files at two commits, or one commit and the current worktree, after
#   applying an optional command pipeline.
#
#   Examples:
#
#   # Compare the number of lines (`wc -l`) in file `foo` at the previous vs.
#   current commit (`-r HEAD^..HEAD`):
#
#   git diff-x -r HEAD^..HEAD wc -l foo
#
#   # Colorized (`-c`) diff of `md5sum`s of `foo`, at HEAD (last committed
#   value) vs. the current worktree content:
#
#   git diff-x -c md5sum foo
#
#   # Use `-` to separate pipeline commands from paths (when more than one path
#   is to be diffed), e.g. this compares the largest 10 numbers in `file{1,2}`
#   (HEAD vs. worktree):
#
#   git diff-x 'sort -rn' head - file1 file2
#
# Options:
#   -c, --color                  Colorize the output
#   -r, --refspec TEXT           <commit 1>..<commit 2> (compare two commits) or
#                                <commit> (compare <commit> to the worktree)
#   -R, --ref TEXT               Diff a specific commit; alias for `-r
#                                <ref>^..<ref>`
#   -s, --shell-executable TEXT  Shell to use for executing commands; defaults
#                                to $SHELL
#   -S, --no-shell               Don't pass `shell=True` to Python
#                                `subprocess`es
#   -U, --unified INTEGER        Number of lines of context to show (passes
#                                through to `diff`)
#   -v, --verbose                Log intermediate commands to stderr
#   -w, --ignore-whitespace      Ignore whitespace differences (pass `-w` to
#                                `diff`)
#   -x, --exec-cmd TEXT          Command(s) to execute before invoking `comm`;
#                                alternate syntax to passing commands as
#                                positional arguments
#   --help                       Show this message and exit.
```

#### Examples <a id="git-diff-x-examples"></a>
Compare line-count (`wc -l`) of this README, before and after commit `8b7a761`:
<!-- `bmdf -- git-diff-x -R 8b7a761 'wc -l' README.md` -->
```bash
git-diff-x -R 8b7a761 'wc -l' README.md
# 1c1
# < 16
# ---
# > 206
```

Examples from `--help` above:
```bash
# Compare the number of lines (`wc -l`) in file `foo` at the previous vs. current commit
# (`-R HEAD` is equivalent to `-r HEAD^..HEAD`).
git diff-x -R HEAD wc -l foo

# Colorized (`-c`) diff of `md5sum`s of `foo`, at HEAD (last committed value) vs. the current
# worktree content.
git diff-x -c md5sum foo

# Use `-` to separate pipeline commands from paths (when more than one path is to be diffed),
# e.g. this compares the largest 10 numbers in `file{1,2}` (HEAD vs. worktree):
git diff-x 'sort -rn' head - file1 file2
```

I use `git-diff-x` via several Git and Bash aliases:

[`.gitconfig`][diff-x git configs]:
```.gitconfig
[alias]
  ; pip install qmdx
  dx = diff-x
  dxc = diff-x -c
  dxcr = diff-x -cR
  dxcrr = diff-x -cr
  dxr = diff-x -R
  dxrr = diff-x -r
  dxw = diff-x -w
  dxwr = diff-x -wR
  dxwrr = diff-x -wr
```

[`.git-rc`][diff-x aliases]:
```bash
alias gdx="g dx"
alias gdxc="g dxc"
alias gdxcr="g dxcr"
alias gdxcrr="g dxcrr"
alias gdxr="g dxr"
alias gdxrr="g dxrr"
alias gdxw="g dxw"
alias gdxwr="g dxwr"
alias gdxwrr="g dxwrr"
