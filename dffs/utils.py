    Args:
        base_cmd: Top=level command that takes two positional args (named pipes with the outputs
            of the ``cmds1`` and ``cmds2`` pipelines).
        cmds1: First sequence of commands to pipe together
        cmds2: Second sequence of commands to pipe together
        verbose: Whether to print commands being executed
        executable: Shell to use for executing commands; defaults to $SHELL
        **kwargs: Additional arguments passed to subprocess.Popen

    Each command sequence will be piped together before being compared.
    For example, if cmds1 = ['cat foo.txt', 'sort'], the function will
    execute 'cat foo.txt | sort' before comparing with cmds2's output.
